# Summary

Added a new "TimeWarp" level featuring a moving gravity well that creates dynamic, spatially-varying time dilation effects. Unlike the static gravity wells in previous levels, this level's gravity source moves through space, requiring the player to navigate changing relativistic conditions. Documentation was also updated to avoid hardcoded screen resolution assumptions.

# Problem

The existing levels only featured static gravity wells, which limited the gameplay variety and the demonstration of relativistic effects. A moving gravity well creates a more challenging and educational experience by showing how time dilation varies as the gravitational source moves.

# Goals

1. Create a new level with a gravity well that moves through space
2. Demonstrate variable time dilation based on changing proximity to the gravity source
3. Update level documentation and remove hardcoded assumptions
