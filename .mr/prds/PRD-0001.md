# Summary

Built the initial playable prototype of the relativity game using the Bevy game engine. This included the core physics engine with Newtonian gravity and special relativity calculations, a player entity with animated sprites and a proper-time clock, a level system with destinations and collision detection, an observer reference clock, a menu system, and CI/CD infrastructure for multi-platform builds.

# Problem

There was no interactive game that let players experience and solve puzzles based on relativistic effects like time dilation. The goal was to create a prototype that simulates gravity wells and relativistic time dilation in a 2D space environment.

# Goals

1. Implement gravity simulation with configurable mass objects
2. Add special relativity time dilation calculations using `nalgebra-spacetime` and `uom`
3. Create a player entity with sprite animation and proper-time tracking
4. Build a level abstraction with destinations, collisions, and exit conditions
5. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for Linux, Windows, and macOS builds
