# Summary

Upgraded the project from an older Bevy version to Bevy 0.17, updating all dependencies to their latest versions. This required fixing breaking API changes (e.g., camera spawning patterns, tuple syntax), adding Wayland dependencies to the CI workflow, and updating version specifiers to use generic ranges.

# Problem

The project was using outdated dependencies from the original 2023 prototype. Bevy 0.17 introduced breaking API changes that needed to be addressed to keep the project maintainable and take advantage of new engine features.

# Goals

1. Update Bevy and all dependencies to latest compatible versions
2. Fix all breaking API changes introduced by the upgrade
3. Ensure CI pipeline works with new dependency requirements
4. Use generic version specifiers for better future compatibility
