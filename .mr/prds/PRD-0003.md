# Summary

Aligned the repository with house-style conventions by adding developer tooling (cargo-make, Trunk.toml), updating documentation (CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, AGENTS.md), improving the CI workflow, and adding a GitHub Copilot instructions file to enable AI-assisted development with proper project context.

# Problem

After the dependency upgrade, the repository lacked standardized developer tooling, comprehensive documentation, and AI-assistance configuration. This made onboarding and contributing harder than necessary.

# Goals

1. Add cargo-make tooling with standard tasks (build, test, ci, uat)
2. Update documentation with contributing guidelines and development instructions
3. Improve CI workflow configuration
4. Configure GitHub Copilot with project-specific instructions
